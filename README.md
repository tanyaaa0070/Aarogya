🩺 **Aarogya**: AI-Powered Multimodal Health Assistant for India’s Frontline Health Workers
🌍 Empowering ASHA & ANM workers with AI — Edge-first, Offline-capable, and Integrated with ABDM

Aarogya is a cutting-edge AI application designed to assist India’s community health workers (CHWs) — such as ASHA and ANM workers — in diagnosing, triaging, and digitally recording patient data at the village level.

Think of it as a “Shazam for coughs”, “Google Lens for rashes”, and “smart medical scribe”, all in one — running entirely on a basic smartphone.

🚀 Core Features
🧠 Multimodal AI Symptom Analysis

Audio AI: Analyzes cough patterns to assess risks of TB, pneumonia, or common cold.

Visual AI: Detects visible symptoms from skin rashes, eye infections, wounds, and anemia.

Voice NLP (Vernacular): Understands spoken symptom descriptions in local Indian languages and dialects.

⚕️ AI-Powered Triage System

Traffic Light Triage:

🔴 Critical: Immediate referral to PHC with auto-generated digital slip.

🟡 Urgent: Visit within 24–48 hours.

🟢 Non-Urgent: Home care advice and follow-up scheduling.

🧾 ABDM Integration

Automatically generates structured clinical notes linked to a patient’s ABHA ID.

Works offline — syncs securely once connectivity is available.

Helps standardize rural health data for the national health stack.

🔒 Responsible & Efficient AI

Augments, not replaces, CHW decision-making.

Explainable outputs (e.g., “Referral recommended due to high fever and rapid breathing”).

Privacy-first design: On-device processing with federated learning.

Scalable data asset: Builds high-quality rural health data for public health analytics.

🧩 Tech Stack

Edge AI Frameworks: TensorFlow Lite / PyTorch Mobile

Speech & NLP: IndicBERT, Whisper, or custom ASR models for local dialects

Computer Vision: EfficientNet / MobileNet for visual analysis

Integration: ABDM APIs for health record management

Storage: Encrypted local DB (SQLite) with secure sync

💡 Vision

To make AI healthcare truly inclusive by empowering India’s first line of care — the Community Health Worker — to provide better, faster, and data-driven healthcare, even in the most remote villages.

🛠️ Future Roadmap

 Pilot in one state (e.g., Uttar Pradesh or Bihar)

 Add maternal & child health modules

 Expand to voice-based health education content

 Integrate with wearable sensors for vitals
